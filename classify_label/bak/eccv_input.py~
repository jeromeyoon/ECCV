  """Reads and parses examples from CIFAR10 data files.

  Recommendation: if you want N-way read parallelism, call this function
  N times.  This will give you N independent Readers reading different
  files & positions within those files, which will give better mixing of
  examples.

  Args:
    filename_queue: A queue of strings with the filenames to read from.

  Returns:
    An object representing a single example, with the following fields:
      height: number of rows in the result (32)
      width: number of columns in the result (32)
      depth: number of color channels in the result (3)
      key: a scalar string Tensor describing the filename & record number
        for this example.
      label: an int32 Tensor with the label in the range 0..9.
      uint8image: a [height, width, depth] uint8 Tensor with the image data
